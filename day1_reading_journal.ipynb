While this journal consists of several required exercises, it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.

    "- high-level code can be run by an **interpreter** which translates and executes one line at a time, or by an **executor** after being compiled into low-level **object code** code by a **compiler**.\n",
    "- python can be written in **interactive mode** with immediate feedback, or **script mode**, where a script is written and executed with one command.\n",
